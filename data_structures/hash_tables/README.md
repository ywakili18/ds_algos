# What are hash tables?

- Hash tables are used to store key-value pairs. (in javascript, built in objects are hash tables)
- The keys are not ordered.
- Python has dictionaries, JS has objects and maps, Java, GO, Sclaa have maps, Ruby has Hashes.

# What makes a good hash function?

1. Fast (constant time)
2. Doesn't cluster outputs at specific indcices, but distributes uniformly.
3. Deterministic (same input yields same output)
