# Kinds of Trees

- Trees: No restriction on parents and children.

- Binary Trees: Each node can have at most two children. (Either 0, 1, 2 children)

- Binary Search Trees (good at searching): usually sorted in a particular way (usually storing numbers, that are sortable and comparable)

## THE BBIGGGGOOOOOOOOO of BST

- Insertion - O(log n)
- Searching - O(log n)
