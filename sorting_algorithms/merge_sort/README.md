# What is a merge sort?

- It's a combination of two things: merging and sorting.
- Exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted.
- Works by decomposiing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements, then building up a newly sorted array.
- Its basically dividing it, then merging by sorting.
