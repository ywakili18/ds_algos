# What is a linked list?

## Is a data structure that contains a head, tail, and length property.

- Linked lists consisted of **nodes**, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null.
- **Head** - is the beginning of the LinkedList.
- **Tail** - is the end, so we don't keep track of every single item in the middle.
- **Length** - Length of the LinkedList.

There are not index or indecies in a LinkedList. To access a specific Linked List value, we start from the beginning, and move onwards.

Its called a Singly Linked List because it points in one direction, only to the next node.
